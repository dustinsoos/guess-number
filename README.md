# guess-number

In this game the user has a chance to guess the random number.

The faster you get it the higher the score you get.

The point of this small JavaScript game was to work on my dom manipulation skills.

In this project related to Javascript I used the use of functions to call back and reset the information that changed when the user won or lost.

I also made click events to apply functionality to the buttons to reset the game.

I learned about resetting values/texts

The point of the game was to learn about building a games functionality from scratch and getting everything to work using query selectors/adding functions
